Adventure-Run-Android
=====================

One of my more recent forays into LibGDX, a 2D endless runner game for Android tablets. While still quite far from being 
complete it does contain several features which make it playable as a game, and I dare say maybe even somewhat enjoyable.
Still, it is very much an Alpha version and I ask you to bear this in mind while playing or sorting through the code.

Also, I've yet to test this game out on Android phones so unless you have a Nexus tablet handy you're better off running
the desktop version :)
